## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge you can test what you have learned regarding CSS Grid, and the positioning of elements using this tool, you can also implement the use of the "nth-child()" pseudoclass to add specific values ​​for each of the four cards present . 

```css
.card:nth-child(1) {
    border-top: 5px solid var(--cyan);
} 

```

Also try implementing semantic HTML.

### Continued development

For future projects I will continue to prioritize the "mobile-first" approach, as well as the use of CSS Grid, and soon I will begin the selection and development of projects that allow me to strengthen and practice the implementation of the JavaScript language, and tools such as CSS preprocessors (SASS).
